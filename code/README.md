## Overview

This project relies on **heavily modified versions** of several third-party libraries and repositories, many of which are hosted as private repositories on GitHub. These modifications are essential for the functionality of this codebase. Without these changes, the code **will not function correctly** and may break entirely. Below are the details you need to understand and work with this project.

## Key Details

### Dependency Modifications

- The project depends on **customized versions** of libraries that differ significantly from their public counterparts.
- These modifications include:
  - Changes to core functionality.
  - Adjustments to APIs and workflows.
  - Addition of project-specific features.

### Private Repositories

- Some dependencies are stored in **private GitHub repositories** and are not available publicly.
- These private repositories contain critical changes and cannot be replaced with their public versions.

### Breakage Without Modifications

Using the unmodified versions of libraries will likely result in:

- **Build/Compilation Errors**: Missing APIs or incompatible dependencies.
- **Runtime Failures**: Logic mismatches or incomplete functionality.
- **Incorrect Results**: Unexpected behavior due to absent custom features.
