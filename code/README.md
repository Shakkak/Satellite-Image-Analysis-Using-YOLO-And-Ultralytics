# Code

## Overview

This project is highly customized and relies on modified versions of several libraries and repositories. Due to the extensive modifications, these dependencies are integral to the proper functioning of the code. However, these libraries and repositories are private and stored within a personal GitHub account. **As a result, the full code cannot be shared in this repository**, as it would be non-functional without access to these private resources.

## Why the Code Cannot Be Shared

### 1. **Custom Modifications**

- The code relies on extensively altered libraries and repositories, tailored specifically to meet project requirements.
- These changes include:
  - Significant modifications to core functionality.
  - Custom features and adjustments that are unavailable in public versions.

### 2. **Private Dependencies**

- Many of the required libraries and repositories are hosted in **private GitHub repositories** and cannot be made public due to:
  - Licensing or proprietary constraints.
  - Security or confidentiality concerns.

### 3. **Code Breakage Without Modifications**

- Attempting to run the code without the modified dependencies will lead to:
  - **Build Errors:** Missing APIs or incompatible functionality.
  - **Runtime Failures:** Crashes or incomplete execution.
  - **Incorrect Behavior:** Inaccurate results or malfunctioning features.

For this reason, sharing only the main code without these dependencies would render it incomplete and unusable.
