# Satellite-Image-Analysis-Using-YOLO-And-Ultralytics
This study explores the application of YOLO-based object detection models to satellite imagery. We compare the performance of YOLOV5, YOLOv7,..., YOLOv9, and various architectural modifications With ultralytics using a dataset of annotated satellite images.
